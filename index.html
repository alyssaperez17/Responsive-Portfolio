      <p>Hello my name is Alyssa. I am from a small town named San Angelo, it is located in the west Texas region. I currently work in IT and run a team of 12 technicians. Our main goal is to keep the business up and running 24/7.</p>

      <p>After high school I went to school to be a pilot. I studied there for two years before moving to Dallas where I discovered my love for technology.</p>

      <p>Joining this class has been one of the hardest challenges I have dealt with in a very long time.</p>
